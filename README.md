Welcome to Spy Game, the board game you can enjoy anywhere, anytime. All you need is a group of friends and the right mood to dive in. To begin, you’ll first choose a theme. Each theme comes with its own set of words and a unique design, giving your game a fresh atmosphere and making every round feel exciting and different.

In Spy Game, there are two roles: AGENT and SPY. The Agents’ mission is to uncover who the Spy is, while the Spy’s goal is to avoid being discovered and escape elimination. It’s a battle of deduction, bluffing, and quick thinking, where every round brings new tension and fun.

When the game starts, all Agents receive the same secret word. After reading it, they must memorize and keep it hidden. The Spy, however, gets no word at all. Their challenge is to act as if they know the word, blending in with the Agents without giving away their lack of knowledge.

Once everyone knows their role, the interrogation phase begins. Players first decide on how long this round will last—either by setting a time limit or agreeing on a fixed number of questions. Then, one by one, they ask and answer questions that hint at the secret word. The Agents should pay close attention, looking for slips or odd answers that might expose the Spy hiding among them.

When the questioning is over, it’s time to vote. Each player chooses the person they suspect is the Spy. If the group accuses an Agent by mistake, that Agent is eliminated and the game moves to the next round. But if the Spy is successfully identified, the Agents win the game instantly. The Spy’s only path to victory is surviving every vote without being caught.Published
